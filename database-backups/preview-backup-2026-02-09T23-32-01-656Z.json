This detox creates space for clarity, focus, and genuine rest. The first 2-3 days are hardest - boredom is the goal. Let yourself be bored. That's when the reset happens.\n\nRemember: You need 32/42 checkmarks to succeed (75%). That's 6 per day on average. Missing a few is OK - this is about progress, not perfection.",
